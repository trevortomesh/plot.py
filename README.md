# plot.py
*"Completely Unnecessary!™"*
------------
This is a little plotting program written in python that probably doesn't even deserve its own repository. It's ridiculously simple and was written up in a couple of minutes using the pyplot library in python. It's here mostly so I don't lose it -- again.

### Dependencies
------------
The following dependencies are required in order to
properly run plot.py!

- python 3.x
- matplotlib
- numpy

Install python 3 (if for some reason you don't already
have it!)
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3
```
Install pip for python 3:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
Install the matlplotlib library (what all this works on top of!)

```bash
pip3 install matplotlib
```

Install numpy -- because math.
```bash
pip3 install numpy
```

### Installation
Just download it and unzip the folder. Ta-da!

### Usage
plot.py will take a tab-delimited table like this:
| ColA          | ColB          |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| 93            | 46            |
| 94            | 56            |
| 95            | 66            |
| 97            | 76            |
| 100           | 86            |
| 103           | 96            |
| 110           | 106           |
