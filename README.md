# plot.py
## "An entirely unnecessary program!"
------------
This is a little plotting program written in python that probably doesn't even deserve its own repository. It's ridiculously simple and was written up in a couple of minutes using the pyplot library in python. It's here mostly so I don't lose it -- again.

### Dependencies
------------
The following dependencies are required in order to
properly run plot.py!

- python 3.x
- matplotlib
- numpy

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3
```

sudo apt-get install python3-pip

```

```bash
